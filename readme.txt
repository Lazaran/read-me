Head to 

lazaran.github.io/js-rubiks-cube

and 

lazaran.github.io/color-picker

to see my current projects. While neither are yet complete, they have the main mechanics designed and functioning.



Rubiks Cube README:

  Controls:

  MouseClick1 + move mouse: Rotate Cube

  Q: Select Front Face // Red
  E: Select Back Face // Orange
  W: Select Top Face // White
  S: Select Bottom Face // Yellow
  A: Select Left Face // Green
  D: Select Right Face // Blue

  Up Arrow: Rotate Clockwise
  Down Arrow: Rotate Counterclockwise


  The cube is not yet complete, I have not implemented a way to change each individual cubes new position and orientation after a face rotation, 
  thus rotating mulitiple faces results in a jumbled mess.



Color Picker README:

  Controls:

  Hover mouse over color gradients to change color

  Top Bar : HUE
  Right Bar : SATURATION
  Left Bar : VALUE

  The big square shows the main color, along with the RGB value for the color

  The smaller square in the top left corner shows the inverse of the main color, along with its RGB value

  This is not yet complete, the intention for this project is to be able to select a color and then copy its value ready for CSS, selecting the format from the menu on the right.
  I have yet to implement the conversion method to for HEX and HSV output, the buttons to select copy type, and the copy button itself.
